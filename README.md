# Random-Graph-Based-Neuro-Network
demo for our work "Random Graph-Based Neuromorphic Learning with a Layer-Weaken Structure"

We provide three kinds of datasets termed MNIST, FashionMNIST and LungCancer. The source codes are written in Python 3.6.
The RGNN established by random graphs can efficiently complete the image classfication with unfixed architecture.
Just run "trainRGNN.py"
